## Quarto
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lterdatasampler)
ggplot(data = pie_crab,
       aes(x = latitude,
           y = size,
           color = latitude)) +
geom_point() +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "#123456",
                       high = "#456789")

```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
